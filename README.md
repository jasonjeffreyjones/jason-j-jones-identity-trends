# Jason Jeffrey Jones' Identity Trends
Web tools, datasets and code for exploring identity change in the United States.

The goal of this project was to create datasets of unprecedented magnitude for the study of personal identity.  Another aim was to make the data accessible and approachable to researchers of all kinds.  I used the methods of computational social science to collect, organize and summarize millions of humansâ€™ self-descriptions.  It is my hope a new generation of social science scholars will make use of these resources to develop and test precise, quantitative models of identity and identity change over the lifespan.
